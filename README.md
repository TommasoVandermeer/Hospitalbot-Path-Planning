# Hospitalbot path planning

> An infrastructure to train RL agents for a motion planning problem in an indoor environment (built with ROS2, Gazebo, OpenAI Gym, and Stable Baselines3).

## Description
This repository contains an application using ROS2 Humble, Gazebo, OpenAI Gym and Stable Baselines3 to train reinforcement learning agents which generate a feasible sequence of motion controls for a robot with a differential drive and a LIDAR to solve a path planning problem.

The robot employed is a Pioneer 3AT with 4-wheel differential drive and a 180Â° laser for obstacle detection. The LIDAR collects 61 distance measurements that can range from 0.08 to 10 meters.

This repository includes the following elements:
* The 3D simulation environment of the hospital with the robot.
* A working Gym environment to train RL agents for the motion planning problem.
* Trained agents capable of reaching short and long distance targets inside the hospital environment while avoiding obstacles more than 80% of the time.

The application should be considered as a practical example for training reinforcement learning models using the open-source software previously mentioned. It is my first project with ROS2, the code is most likely not perfect, but it worked for my purpose.

## Current status
As this project was developed only for my Master's degree thesis, do not expect many updates over time. I published my work in the hope that I could help someone like me who is starting from scratch with ROS2 applications.

More information about the project can be found inside my thesis, which is available [here](.documents/A_reinforcement_learning_approach_to_path_planning_for_mobile_robots.pdf).

## Installation
### Prerequisites
* ROS2 Humble or ROS2 Foxy (with Ubuntu 22.04 LTS or Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, respectively) - [install ROS2 Humble](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation.html);
* An already configured ROS2 workspace - [ROS2 workspace creation tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GbrKQ7G2P0);
* Gazebo integration for ROS2 - [install gazebo_ros_pkgs](http://classic.gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=ros2_installing&cat=connect_ros);
* Stable Baselines3 (includes also Gym) - [install Stable Baselines3](https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/en/master/guide/install.html);
* Tensorboard - [install Tensorboard with pyp](https://pypi.org/project/tensorboard/);
* Optuna (for hyperparameters tuning) - [install Optuna](https://optuna.org/#installation);
### Step-by-step installation guide
First of all, clone this repository inside the src folder of your ROS2 workspace (replace `ros2_ws` with the name of your ROS2 workspace):
```
cd ~/ros2_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/TommasoVandermeer/Hospitalbot-Path-Planning.git
```
You will need to copy all the files inside the `models` and `photos` folders inside the `~/.gazebo` repository. However, if you have never run Gazebo, the `~/.gazebo/models` and `~/.gazebo/photos` folders might not exist yet. To create them, simply launch the Gazebo empty world:
```
gazebo
```
Now, close the Gazebo window and the folders should have been created. Copy the files using these commands (replace `ros2_ws` with the name of your ROS2 workspace):
```
cd ~/ros2_ws/src/Hospitalbot-Path-Planning/hospital_robot_spawner
cp -r models/. ~/.gazebo/models
cp -r photos/. ~/.gazebo/photos
```
At this point, build your ROS2 workspace to effectively install the package (replace `ros2_ws` with the name of your ROS2 workspace).
```
cd ~/ros2_ws
colcon build --packages-select hospital_robot_spawner
```
To check that everything is working, try to launch the hospital world.
```
ros2 launch hospital_robot_spawner gazebo_world.launch.py
```
The hospital world should be opened with the Gazebo application. Also the Pioneer 3AT should appear.

## Getting started
The application is quite complicated because it includes various modes. For this reason, before running anything, often the main scripts must be edited. I am planning on building a parameters file where all the specifics can be changed so that all the other files can remain untouched.

### Run a random agent
Running a random agent helps to understand the basic concepts of the Gym environment developed. Before running the commands, some files need to be edited.

* Open the "hospitalbot_env.py" file, search the `self._randomize_env_level` attribute of the **HospitalBotEnv** class and set one mode between the ones available (recommended: 0, 3, or 5). Also, make sure that the `self._visualize_target` attribute is set to True, otherwise the target will not be visualized. **Save the file at the end**.
* Edit the "start_training.py" file as follows. Search the `self._training_mode` attribute of the **TrainingNode** classe and assign the "random_agent" string to it. Below in the code, the number of episode to be simulated can be set (it should be 10 by default). **Save the file at the end**.
* Now, build your package again (replace `ros2_ws` with the name of your ROS2 workspace): `cd ~/ros2_ws;
colcon build --packages-select hospital_robot_spawner`.

After it is all set, launch the world file:
```
ros2 launch hospital_robot_spawner gazebo_world.launch.py
```
Finally, open another terminal and run the random agent script.
```
ros2 launch hospital_robot_spawner start_training.launch.py
```

### Run a trained agent
There are various trained agents inside the `rl_models` folder. To test one of them, some files need to be edited first.

* Edit the "trained_agent.py" script as follows. Find the `trained_model_path` variable and replace the last element of the `os.path.join` with the name of the desired agent (e.g., PPO_risk_seeker.zip). Save the file at the end.
* Edit the "hospitalbot_env.py" file to make sure that the correct mode is selected. Search the `self._randomize_env_level` attribute of the **HospitalBotEnv** class and pick one of the listed modalities (e.g., 6). Also, make sure that the `self._visualize_target` attribute is set to True, otherwise the target will not be visualized. Save the file at the end.
* Now, build your package again (replace `ros2_ws` with the name of your ROS2 workspace): `cd ~/ros2_ws;
colcon build --packages-select hospital_robot_spawner`.

After it is all set, launch the world file:
```
ros2 launch hospital_robot_spawner gazebo_world.launch.py
```
Finally, open another terminal and run the trained agent.
```
ros2 launch hospital_robot_spawner trained_agent.launch.py
```
### Train a new agent
* Firstly, edit the "hospitalbot_env.py" file. Set the `self._randomize_env_level` attribute to "5" as this mode implements the best setting to train an agent. Also, make sure that the `self._visualize_target` attribute is set to False, target visualization slows down the training significantly.
* Open the "start_training.py" file. Set the `self._training_mode` attribute to "training". Scroll down to the training section of the code inside the `elif node._training_mode == "training"` condition. Here, specify the number of total timesteps for which the agent is trained, and set the name of the agent file and the log file as you please.
* Now, build your package again (replace `ros2_ws` with the name of your ROS2 workspace): `cd ~/ros2_ws;
colcon build --packages-select hospital_robot_spawner`.

Once the changes are made, launch the training world. This launch file will not launch the graphical interface of Gazebo to make the training faster.
```
ros2 launch hospital_robot_spawner headless_world.launch.py
```
Finally, open another terminal and start the training using the command below.
```
ros2 launch hospital_robot_spawner start_training.launch.py
```
If you want to monitor the training process, open another terminal and type these commands (replace `ros2_ws` with the name of your ROS2 workspace).
```
cd ~/ros2_ws/src/Hospitalbot-Path-Planning/hospital_robot_spawner
tensorboard --logdir=logs
```
At the end of the terminal there should be a link that you can open to visualize the tensorboard toolkit.
